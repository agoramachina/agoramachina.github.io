									<p><br>
									The purpose of this portfolio--and my work at large--is to act as a voice to empower those outside the norm and to appeal to an audience who struggles to understand them. It is an affirmation of the mind in all its complex, unique forms. It is a celebration of diversity and the way our differences give us strength. By presenting my truth to the world, by living with integrity and courage, I hope to inspire others to do the same. </p>

									<p>
									It's unsurprising that I should find myself pursuing Interdisciplinary Studies. Even after beginning my academic career at the University of Central Florida with a double major in Philosophy and Computer Science, my appetite for knowledge was never sated. Although I eagerly devoured additional lectures and textbooks outside of class and made great progress in my independent studies, I found myself caught up in every interesting thread with little way to tie everything together. I knew of UCF's interdisciplinary studies major but had given it little consideration; why pursue one rounded major when you can go for two separate degrees? Or five? What I had overlooked back then was that interdisciplinary studies offers a unique perspective that can't be found in a multidisciplinary approach alone. </p>

									<p>
									The practice of interdisciplinarity resonates on a deeply personal level. To integrate disparate ideas, to find threads of meaning that unify concepts across borders, to expand and narrow one's perspective by situating each element in context within a greater whole: these things have not only defined my academic approach, but the way I have been able to comprehend my own identity. In particular, fractals--once labeled "monstrous" and "pathological"--have become a passionate interest that has provided insight into the way that coherence can emerge from apparent chaos--a concept that I strongly identify with. To illustrate this, I have included a selection of art and music that is designed to capture the fractal lens through which I interpret the world and express myself. </p>

									<p>
									The first piece is titled Dissolution of Self (Links to an external site.), part of a larger self-portrait series that represents my own experience of dissociation and plurality. Generated with gnofract4d, it uses fractals to represent the chaos and beauty of the mind. The next two pieces, included in my LSYSten (Links to an external site.) project, are titled LSYSten (Links to an external site.) and LSYStrange (Links to an external site.). Both were generated with LMuseJ, a Lindenmayer System generator that translates fractals into midi tones. Despite a significant difference in sound and mood, they represent the exact same equation, with the exact same rules and axioms--the only difference is the instruments used to represent each voice. These two pieces together serve as a reflection of the way that different perspectives can reflect a shared underlying truth. </p>

									<p>
									While I have learned a great deal in the course of my personal and academic life, I know that my journey is just beginning. As I continue to push onward by unravelling the threads of complexity, I find myself learning more both about myself and the world around me, often in strange and unexpected ways. I hope to always keep an open mind and welcome the perspective that experience brings as I strive to make my voice heard through my work. </p>
