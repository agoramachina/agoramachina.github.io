										<h4><i>The most exciting phrase to hear in science, the one that heralds new discoveries, is not “Eureka” but “That’s funny...”</i></h4>
										<h4><center><i>--Isaac Asimov</i></center></h4>

									<div>
										<p><br>Curiosity is central to who I am. Whether personally, professionally, or academically, I find myself compelled by an obsessive drive to seek knowledge wherever it can be found. This drive has led to a passion for learning both in and out of school, combining the structure of formal education with the freedom of independent learning. My approach is eclectic: although the resources and tools I have obtained throughout my academic career at UCF have been invaluable in grounding and guiding my research, my primary source of knowledge is through the pursuit of my own interests.</p>


										<p>I enjoy taking a learning-through-doing approach in my pursuit of knowledge, HUDbeat being a primary example. I initially set out to create a tool that could assist in understanding and shaping my own mind, which required a thorough review of scholarly articles on psychology, neuroscience, and technology. I programmed an Arduino to detect heart rate and used years of self-taught Linux expertise to control the Raspberry Pi that served as the “brains” of the project. Designing the hardware required knowledge of Fritzing, OpenSCAD, and Inventor, which I learned in order to model and build the electronic systems and their casings. As a work-in-progress, there is a great deal I look forward to learning as I continue the project. Some of these knowledge gaps are known, with a plan to fill them. But most exciting to me are the unknown unknowns: knowledge that I’m not yet aware of lacking, but look forward to discovering!</p>
